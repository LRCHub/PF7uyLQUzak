Yeah, aight
Check it out kids, this is the day you've been waiting for
Yeah, huh

The last day of school, the
Last day of school, it's the
Last day of school, woohah
The last day of school

It's finally here today
The schoolwork's done and it was fun
But now it's time to play
Now you and all your friends just waitin' for that bell
And when it rings you start to sing or even start to yell
It's the last, last day of school, woohah
And you don't stop, I know you like this song
But the tick and tock up on the clock is just taking much too long
You got to go
It's summer time and it's time to get some sun
So all you kids just gather round, it's time to have big fun
'Cause it's the

Last day of school, woohah
Last day of school, the
Last day of school, it's the
Last day of school, the
Last day of school, check it out, the
Last day of school, the
Last day of school, it's the
Last day of school, the
Last day of school, Master Gee

It's the Master Gee and I'm on the go
I wanna rap to the kids some more
About gettin' outta school, stayin' in line
And to make sure, your summer's fine
If you're feeling sad and low
Speak to a friend, and let 'em know
That school is where you wanna be
And it's no time to party
Take your books, and a pen
To start learn all over again
To be ahead of your friend
To answer all kinda things
It's Sugarhill, one more time
Rappin' in the summer time
Rappin' in the summer time
Rappin' in the summer time

Hippie-a-hop, you don't stop
Sugarhill, come on! Come on!
Master Gee, Wonder Mike, Big Bank Hank
Davy D, Franky G
Sugarhill, baby

We got the B-I-G B-A-N-K
School is over and it's time to play
Baseball, double dutch, ride a bike
Later on in the day we can all fly kites
Go to the beach, playin' in the sand
Man oh man, ain't it grand?
Go to the park, play hide-go-seek
Count to a hundred and you better not peek
The birds are out, the bees are here
It's my favorite time of year
Check it out y'all, the weather's hot
Get your fun on, and you don't stop

Yeah, come on, come on
You don't stop, come on, you don't stop
Sugarhill baby, Sugarhill baby
Yeah

The last day of school, the (Say what?)
Last day of school, it's the
Last day of school, the
Last day of school, one more time

Woo

Last day of school, the (Say, what, say what?)
Last day of the school, the ...
