Looky, looky yonder
Looky, looky yonder
Looky, looky yonder
Looky, looky yonder
Where the sun done gone

He was searching
Blindly night and day
This life, there must be more
Breaking beauty, just to stay awake
His heart was like a stone
Ooh, ooh, his heart was like a stone

And on the last day
He walked out in the sun
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day
And on the last day
When all this work was done
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day

All this rapture
Right here all along
In scraps he tore away
All this colour
In his final breath
Exhaled dark and grey
Ooh, ooh, exhaled dark and grey

And on the last
He walked out in the sun
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day
And on the last day
When all this work was done
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day

Looky, looky yonder
Looky, looky yonder
Looky, looky yonder
Looky, looky yonder
Where the sun done gone
